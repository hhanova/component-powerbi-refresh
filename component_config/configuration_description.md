The main purpose of this application is to refresh configured datasets within a workspace.
Be aware! Each configuration can only work with one workspace, meaning that if you want to refresh datasets from another workspaces, you will have to create a new configuration to send "refresh" requests to the workspace.

## Parameters

1. Workspace
    - The workspace where the user wants to output their dataset
    - Please leave this blank if the user is exporting the dataset into the signed in account's "My Workspace"

2. Datasets
    - ID of the dataset within the configured workspace the user wish to refresh
