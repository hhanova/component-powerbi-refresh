The main purpose of 'PowerBI Refresh' application is to refresh the configured datasets within a PowerBI Workspace. Be aware! Each 'PowerBI Refresh' application's configuration can only work with one PowerBI Workspace, meaning that if you want to refresh PowerBI datasets from another PowerBI Workspaces, you will have to create a new 'PowerBI Refresh' configuration to send "refresh" requests to the PowerBI Workspace.
